# StockBuy-Hold-Sell-Indicator
## Project description
This is a small webscraper project which collects data from two different sites using python beautifulsoup.
It provides simple recommendation of whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock
for people who are unfamiliar on evaluating a stock.
## How it works.
The user is prompted to input a stock ticker.
The program scrapes and provides real time stock data from yahoo finance.
The program also scrapes analyst recommendation on the stock from barchart, a company that provides stock information
on whether to buy/hold/sell the stock according to the price.

##Things to note
Header should be modified according to each users chrome version using chrome://version in order to retrieve proper data from barchart.com
